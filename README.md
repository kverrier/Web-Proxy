# Web Proxy
---

## Overview

This is a thread-based concurrent web proxy with caching. This was the
final assignment of 15-213 Computer Systems. The main files I authored
were:

-   proxy.h &amp; proxy.c
-   cache.h &amp; cache.c

In addition to the core files, the following were used for testing:

-   driver.pl
-   concurrency_test.sh

For implementation details, please refer to source files.
